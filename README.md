# Image Repository Web App
A simple backend image repository web app powered by NodeJS and PostgreSQL.


------
### Run the application locally
1. Excecute `npm install` (if you have not done so already)
2. Start Docker and execute `docker run --name db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d -p 5432:5432 postgres`
3. Then, once the database is active, execute `npm start`
    - If the database is not yet running, you will get an error stating: "SequelizeConnectionError: Connection terminated unexpectedly". To resolve this issue, wait until the postgres server is active and execute the command again.


### General interaction flow
1. Create a new user via `POST http://localhost:8080/user` (since each image is associated to a user)
2. Upload an image via `POST http://localhost:8080/image`
3. Then you can manipulate the uploaded data (delete, list, etc.) using the various functions listed below in the API summary (i.e. retrieval via `GET http://localhost:8080/image?imageId={imageId}`)

### API Summary
**General notes**:
    - All parameters sent in the body of requests must be in the format of `form-data`
    - If you are using Postman, you can have the authorization header (including encoding) be auto-generated by selecting `Basic Auth` as the type in the `Authorization` section of the request generation
        - If not using Postman, an example authentication entry located in the header is:
            - Actual value: `1:password` (repersenting userId=1 and userPassword=password)
            - Entry in header: `authorization: Basic MTpwYXNzd29yZA`
